1. Merge your changes from `cd` into `main`. If you created the pull request in step 1, just open that PR and click on **Merge pull request**. If you did not create the pull request earlier, you can do it now by following the instructions in step 1.
1. (optional) Delete the branch `cd`.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
