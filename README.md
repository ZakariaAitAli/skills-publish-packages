## Step 2: Add a Dockerfile

_You created a publishing workflow! :tada:_

We will add a `Dockerfile` to the `cd` branch. The `Dockerfile` contains a set of instructions that get stored in a `Docker Image`. If you'd like, you can [learn more about Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a Dockerfile

1. In the `cd` branch, create `Dockerfile` at the project root and include:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM nginx:1.24-alpine
   COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
   ```
1. Commit your changes.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
